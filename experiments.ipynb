    "## Experiment: LLM RAG-Based Question Answering from FHIR Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the CS 6440 Introduction to Health Informatics class. This notebook is designed for students to experiment with using LLM RAG-based question answering from FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) data. You will be extracting clinical notes from FHIR resources, loading the notes into a vector database (Chroma DB), and using a Language Learning Model (LLM) for inference to answer user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract clinical notes from FHIR resources.\n",
    "- Load extracted data into Chroma DB as a vector database.\n",
    "- Use the Google Flan-T5 model to answer specific clinical questions.\n",
    "- Compare the generated answers with pre-generated OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model answers as ground truth.\n",
    "- Evaluate the quality of the answers provided by Flan-T5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic understanding of FHIR resources.\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "- Basic knowledge of machine learning and natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patient Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided 9 patient bundles in this notebook. These bundles contain the necessary FHIR resources needed for the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the provided data, load it into the vector database and conduct the experiments to answer the following questions accurately:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What allergies does the patient have? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "2. **What medications is the patient currently taking? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "3. **What immunizations has the patient received? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "4. **What is the patient's primary diagnosis? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "5. **What procedures were conducted on the patient? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "6. **What treatments have been administered during the recent visit? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "7. **What is the patient's history of present illness? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "8. **What are the patient's vital info? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "9. **What findings are mentioned in the patient's assessment and plan? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "10. **What follow-up care is planned for the patient? Answer correctly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load FHIR Data:**\n",
    "   - Extract clinical notes from the provided patient bundles.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Vector Database Setup:**\n",
    "   - Load the extracted clinical notes into Chroma DB as vectors.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Model Inference:**\n",
    "   - Use the Google Flan-T5 model to infer answers to the questions based on the vectorized data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Compare the inferred answers with the pre-generated OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model answers.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the quality and accuracy of the Flan-T5 model's answers.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of machine learning, particularly in the areas of transfer learning and model prediction, the temperature attribute is used to control the randomness of predictions. It is commonly applied in softmax functions to adjust the probability distribution of output classes. By modifying the temperature value, you can make the model's predictions either more confident (lower temperature) or more uncertain (higher temperature). Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Temperature**: The probabilities of different classes become more uniform, making the model's predictions less confident and more exploratory.\n",
    "- **Low Temperature**: The probabilities of the most likely classes become higher, making the model's predictions more confident and deterministic.\n",
